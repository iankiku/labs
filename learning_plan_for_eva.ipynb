    "### Important Learning Principles ‚≠ê\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practice is Essential**\n",
    "- Remember: Practice each concept multiple times\n",
    "- Repetition is key to understanding\n",
    "- Code every day, even if it's just for 30 minutes\n",
    "- Build small projects to reinforce learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embrace Your Errors** üö®\n",
    "- Every error is a learning opportunity\n",
    "- When your code fails, celebrate! It means you're pushing your boundaries\n",

    "- Remember: The error message and code never lie\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid Tutorial Hell**\n",
    "- If you're watching more than coding, you're doing it wrong\n",
    "- Practice actively, don't just passively consume content\n",
    "- Challenge yourself to code without following along\n",
    "- Set a maximum video watching time (e.g., 20% watching, 80% coding)\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Structure your learning:\n",
    "   - Create separate notebooks for concepts:\n",
    "     - `python_basics.ipynb`\n",
    "     - `data_structures.ipynb`\n",
    "     - `functions_and_methods.ipynb`\n",
    "   - Create project notebooks:\n",
    "     - `project_calculator.ipynb`\n",
    "     - `project_todo_list.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Document your learning:\n",
    "   - Add comments explaining concepts\n",
    "   - Note common errors and solutions\n",
    "   - Keep a learning journal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Daily Learning Process üìù\n",
    "1. Review previous day's concepts (15 mins)\n",
    "2. Learn new concept (30 mins)\n",
    "3. Practice exercises (45 mins)\n",
    "4. Work on a project (30 mins)\n",
    "5. Reflect and document learning (15 mins)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem-Solving Approach üéØ\n",
